This project is very simple Bench Power Suplly that consists of a TZT XYS3580 (the controler) a Type-C PD decoy module 20v (that powers the system) and the output connectors (Bannana plugs,screw Terminal,XT60 female).
The output Voltage and Amps depends not only in the a Type-C PD decoy module but also in the type-c caple and power brick.Maximum voltage input/output 30v and Maximum Amps 5A.More details are shown in the spread sheet bellow

Upgradey/Customize: Customize and upgrade the power suplly is easy as not only the 3D model but also the circut is very simple. 

Potential upgrades : Adding/Removeing Output Connectors , Removing Type-C PD decoy module for a higher voltage one or a diffrent type of input ,the TZT XYS3580 for a higher end controller
(not recomended upgrade as the TZT XYS3580 is a very trustworthy and cheap module)
